**\*3 Methods For Adding CSS**

```
(a)Inline CSS->Where you link css directly into the HTML element.This is not the
recommended way and any professional developer does not to this.

One of the best recommeded practice as a developer is separation of concerns

(b)Where i use a style tag on top of the file but within a single document.

(c)External CSS.This entails linking an external .css file(suggested all the time)
